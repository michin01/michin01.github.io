<p>
Generally, my research sits between human-computer interaction and learning. My interests include:  novice/end-user programming,  blocks-based programming environments (like Scratch, App Inventor, Looking Glass, and Alice), example code use, recommending help to programmers, computer science education, and crowdsourcing.
